## Hi, I’m Mihnea 👋

I’m a high school student from Romania who enjoys going deep into how things work — from low-level systems and algorithms to modern AI systems and developer tools. I like building things that are both technically interesting and actually useful.

I started out in competitive programming and national olympiads, then gradually moved into artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and real-world applications — from AI competitions to contributing to the national AI olympiad ecosystem and working on production-style GenAI systems during an internship.

Right now, I’m especially interested in LLM systems, applied machine learning, and tooling that helps developers work more efficiently.

### 🧠 Areas of Focus

* Low-level systems programming (C / C++)
* Competitive programming (Codeforces, CSAcademy, infoarena)
* Developer tools and Neovim plugin development
* Applied AI, ML pipelines, and LLM-based systems
* Cybersecurity (CTFs, reverse engineering)
* Hackathon projects and practical software solutions

**Currently:** preparing for AI competitions, working on LLM-based projects, and building developer tools in C++ and Python.
