## Hi there 👋

I'm Mihnea-Teodor Stoica — a high school student passionate about building software that solves real problems. My work spans systems programming, developer tools, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and algorithmic problem solving.

I'm actively involved in competitive programming, AI, cybersecurity, and STEM olympiads — not just as a participant, but as someone who aims to deeply understand systems and build tools that matter.
